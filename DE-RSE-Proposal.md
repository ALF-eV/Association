# Working Title: Software Repository and sponsorship/maintenance of German Open-Source Research Software Projects

## Preamble/Intent
Within the public german research sector it is difficult to bring together funds from outside
partys with the software projects that have applied for them.
In a first step ee intend to change that by providing a software repository of fundable software projects
together with a file of able developers and bridge the institutional gap via
the facilities of DE-RSE.
With the carrot of advertisements for software projects or the possibility of easier obtaining funds 
it should be possible to quickly fill the repository and foster networking/standardization across the software projects.



## Prerequisites for the software project
Open Source, Research, and Germany(? funding <-> networking) based I think.
We can think about whether we want any other contribution towards DE-RSE from the project.

##  Funding
Within the public German research sector it can be difficult to deliver funds from outside
parties to the software projects that have applied for them.
We intend to change that by providing a repository of fundable software projects
as well as a directory of able developers and bridge the institutional gap via 
the facilities of DE-RSE.

## Processes
Since we are dealing with money that a project has succesfully applied for, we should have from the start transparent
processes for the services that we offer:
### Distribution of named/tagged Donations to a single project
If a single project has successfully applied for money we must ensure that almost all of the money
goes to the project. So this money has to have some kind of tag.
If the developers, paid for contributing to the project, are not meaningfully part of DE-RSE we can consider
a fee like 12€ (approximate fee for a bank account, that they would have needed anyway) for our intermediation.

### Collection of unnamed donations towards a single project
I envision that we can have a web interface of projects VERY similar to what the Wau Holland Stiftung has:
https://www.wauland.de/de/donate/
where people can select to which project to donate.
For this process we should also collect our knowledge how German research entities can donate 
to us. People often don't know whom to talk to with respect to this issue.

### Collection of donation/funds towards the entire repository
We can offer this process for the undecided, who just want to fund ALL/ANY of the projects.
Then we need to decide on a distribution mechanism.
Gießkannen-Prinzip? Internal competitive process where the projects may apply (similar to ct.qmat flex funds)?
At the sole discretion of the Vorstand?

### File of Open Source Developers
We can collect contact data of persons who are willing to work on research software projects on
a freelance basis and thereby facilitate bringing skilled/reliable developers together with projects in need of
manpower.

## Software Repository
We should be able to build up a repository of affiliated software projects.
This gives us various opportunities for further cross-fertilization across
the projects.
To repeat I very much liked the idea from here https://www.wauland.de/de/donate/

This should also give us an overview of the landscape of software projects. Together with NFDI4RSE this would give another
opportunity for standardization in finding commonalities across software projects.

### Chapters
Our original Verein had the notion of chapters that collect projects of similar interests.
This would make funding easier for funders who can only fund projects of a given field/type.
For that reason we would start with a "High Performance Computing" Chapter so that we can collect funds 
from such entities.

#### List of possible Chapters
- HPC
- Python
- Machine Learning/AI
- Data Management 
- Combination with the local DE-RSE chapters.

## Open questions/ further ideas
- collection of funds vs. Gemeinnützigkeit of DE-RSE
- for which time scales may we collect donations?
- should we work together with https://techcultivation.org/#overview so that DE-RSE is an affiliated organization for them?
- How much accounting overhead will that be for the Schatzmeister?
- Transparency thingies: Maybe we should think about a public yearly report about how we distributed this money. We could even go so far as having that as a requirement for participation.
- We should strive to work on the networking aspects and extend the collaborations beyond germany at least across europe.
- Is it a requirement that the host institution is somehow germany based? If we emphasize the networking aspect I would say no. If a possible funder requires it, then maybe yes...
- What do we call the funds we hand out? Stipends seems to have been the best wording.
- We should forward the offer for stipends also to the other national RSE chapters, maybe also post them here: https://society-rse.org/careers/vacancies/
- standardization: NFDI4RSE has another venue of acting across the disciplines.
